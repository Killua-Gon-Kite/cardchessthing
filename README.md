Well then, you've come across our passion project if you're reading this. Well the basic fundamental thing which we thought of while creating this, is adding chess and playing cards into the same game.

## The Merging of the two

Chess and cards, though they may seem like two very different games, there is indeed a bridge. And that bridge is matching cards with pieces.

#### King

Well this remains the same as the normal king of chess, movement is in a 3x3 grid next to the king. Same old same old.

#### Queen

Same applies to the queen, she has the movement of the rook and the bishop

#### Jack

Well this is something new, and we propose a new piece, which can also be promoted.

The jack itself can switch places with any of its own teammates (for example a white jack can switch with any white piece)

The movement of both the jack and the jack of all trades is a 3x3, like the king, but it cannot move horizontally

##### Jack of all trades

The promoted version of the Jack, this piece can now switch places of any of its teammates with any of its teammates (for example a black jack of all trades can move swap any black pieces around)

#### Cards 10-2

For all cards that have a numbering (excluding ace), the system that we proposed is that you can buy any amount of pieces.

Take into example:

pawn - 1 point
knight - 3 point
bishop - 3 point
rook - 5 point

so depending on the number you get, that many pieces are available to you
(points carry over if they aren't spent)

#### Ace

The Ace is supposed to be kind of a win-all situation, so what we did is give it the ability to shift to any piece available, excluding the joker

#### Joker

And last but not least, the joker. The joker itself is practically a suicide piece, after 5 turns have ended, regardless of what team a piece is on, it instantly dies.

take into example:

x: represents a white piece
y: represents a black piece
z: represents a white joker

in a:

xxy
yzx
xyy

and on turn 5, the joker will kill all of the xs and ys
